      <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
      My name is Joseph and i am a 25 year old from illinois. 
   I tend to be a pretty introverted person but I can handle a social situation if I need to.
    I have lived in the same place my entire life born and raised here in edwardsville.

   <p>
      A smaller college town home to SIUE. Its usually a quiet town with not to much going on but its where ive lived my whole life.
With it being a smaller town there isn't really a ton to do around here so what do I do with my time?

   While it has recieved a bad rep in the past video games have been my biggest past time since I was young.
Playing games like Final Fantasy and Resident Evil were likely things that defined me heavily even today.
I still play many of those games to this day and my current title has been Persona 3 Reloaded.
A newer release of an old game that part of the Persona series, a series heavly based on the story of the fools journey.
To not hyperfixate to much I'll leave you to do your own research if any of that intrests you.

My other on and off again hobby has been art and the creation of concept art. Most definently a continuation of my gaming hobby, 
the concept art always amazes me how people create entire new characters and designs from imagination. While I have tried on and off again
to learn the way even going to school for art I still find myself behind where I would hope to be as most artist would say. I hope to one day
be able to create characters of my own and bring them into being weather through animation, concept design, modeling, or coding them in myself.
